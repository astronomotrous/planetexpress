PlanetExpress
=============
PlanetExpress is my custom Network Attached Storage (NAS), developed on the [Banana Pi](http://www.banana-pi.org).

# Features

* NFS mounted server
* Music organized by [Beets](https://github.com/sampsyo/beets)

I've chosen the name **PlanetExpress** as homage to my favorite TV show ever, [Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama) (most of my devices follow a Futurama-themed nomenclature 😁🚀 ).
